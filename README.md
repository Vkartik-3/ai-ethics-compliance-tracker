## 🔭 Overview

The AI Ethics Compliance Tracker is a comprehensive system designed to help organizations monitor, analyze, and ensure compliance with AI ethics policies. By leveraging both relational (PostgreSQL) and graph (Neo4j) databases, the system provides powerful insights into policy relationships, risk assessment, and compliance tracking.

> **Note:** This project is currently in the planning and early development stage. The repository structure and documentation will evolve as the project progresses.

## ✨ Features

**Planning Stage - Features to be implemented:**

- **Policy Scraping & Ingestion**: Automated collection of AI ethics policies from major tech companies
- **Dual Database Architecture**: 
  - PostgreSQL for structured data and efficient queries
  - Neo4j for relationship mapping and graph-based analysis
- **NLP-Powered Risk Assessment**: Fine-tuned BERT model for analyzing policy text and identifying risks
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit-based visualization of compliance metrics and risk heatmaps
- **RESTful API**: FastAPI endpoints for integration with existing systems
- **Graph Visualization**: Interactive network graphs showing relationships between companies, policies, and risks
- **Automated Reporting**: Scheduled compliance reports and risk alerts
- **OAuth2 Security**: Secure API access with proper authentication

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-ethics-compliance-tracker.git
cd ai-ethics-compliance-tracker

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start the databases with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Run the ETL pipeline
python etl/scraper.py

uvicorn app.api.main:app --reload

# Start the dashboard
streamlit run app/dashboard/main.py
```

## 📘 API Documentation

Once the project reaches the API development phase, the API documentation will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Planned Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/companies` | GET | List all companies with ethics policies |
| `/companies/{id}/policies` | GET | Get policies for a specific company |
| `/risks` | GET | List all identified compliance risks |
| `/predict` | POST | Analyze a new policy text for risks |
| `/graph/company-risks` | GET | Get graph data for company-risk relationships |
